		<h2>The Worm Store</h2>
		<h3>The Odd Exterior</h3>
		<p>Like anyone else, my curiosity was intrigued when a new store opened nearby. It seemed quite small when I went to examine it for myself, and it had an interestingly colored exterior: <em>purple</em>. I am not one to judge, and at this point, I was even more curious. A sign was displayed above the door in colorful letters that read "Welcome Sale! All Worms are Half Off." And so, beyond the exterior I went, ready to document what was held behind the colorful exterior of a worm shop.<p/>
		<h3>Inside The Questionable Store</h3>
		<p>A tall, slender man in a funny suit and top hat immediately greeted me with confidence, and around the store were many, many different customers just as intrigued as I was. When I asked what kind of worms he sold, he simply stated <q>Fuzzy, friendly ones.</q> After getting ready to doubt the whole trip and question the man's sanity, he then proceeded to take out a small, blue object from his pocket. Fascinated, I looked down and gazed upon the small, fluffy worm-like creature that settled in his palm. He wasn't kidding, and not only was he not kidding, but the worm began to move around happily, it's soft and fuzzy texture brushing against the man's palm as he held it.</p>
		<h3>The Conclusion</h3>
		<p>I have never seen anything like it before. It was like a long, funny-looking caterpillar. The man explained that he had many of these worms, and he began showing me around the shop. In the small, cozy space being used, the man managed to use it all wisely: worms were securely settled into little containers comfortably, ranging from tiny little inch-worms to long, fuzzy ones that you needed two hands to hold. They were all colorful, ranging from the many hues in the rainbow to the black and white shades of the grayscale. For a low low price of $5, I purchased a funny-looking green one and named him Asparagus.<b/>
